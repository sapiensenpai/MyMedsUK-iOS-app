# Sign in with Apple - Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

Your app now has a **fully configured** Sign in with Apple implementation following Apple's best practices.

### What's Already Done:

1. ✅ **Entitlements Configured** - `MyMeds_UKultra.entitlements` file created
2. ✅ **AuthenticationService** - Proper delegate implementation
3. ✅ **Keychain Storage** - Secure credential persistence
4. ✅ **Credential State Checking** - Detects revoked access
5. ✅ **LoginView** - Beautiful UI with proper button

## 🔧 Xcode Project Configuration

### Step 1: Add Sign in with Apple Capability

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Select your app target (MyMeds_UKultra)
3. Go to **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
4. Click the **"+ Capability"** button
5. Search for **"Sign in with Apple"**
6. Add it to your project

**Alternatively, Xcode should automatically detect the entitlements file we created.**

### Step 2: Verify Entitlements File is Linked

1. In Xcode, select your target
2. Go to **"Build Settings"**
3. Search for **"Code Signing Entitlements"**
4. Ensure it points to: `MyMeds_UKultra/MyMeds_UKultra.entitlements`

If it's not set, add it manually:
```
MyMeds_UKultra/MyMeds_UKultra.entitlements
```

## 🍎 Apple Developer Portal Configuration

### Step 1: Enable Sign in with Apple for Your App ID

1. Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Select **Identifiers**
4. Find your app identifier: `com.isaac.MyMeds-UKultra`
5. Enable **"Sign in with Apple"** capability
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Update Provisioning Profiles

After enabling the capability:
1. Go to **Profiles** section
2. Delete old provisioning profiles
3. Xcode will automatically create new ones with the updated capability

## 🧪 Testing Sign in with Apple

### Testing on Simulator:

1. **Ensure you're signed in with an Apple ID in Simulator:**
   - Open **Settings** app in Simulator
   - Go to **Apple ID** (at the top)
   - Sign in with your Apple ID
   - You can use a test Apple ID or your personal one

2. **Run your app** and tap the Sign in button

### Testing on Physical Device:

1. Ensure your device is signed in with an Apple ID
2. Build and run on device
3. Sign in with Apple should work seamlessly

### Important Testing Notes:

- **First time users**: Will see full name and email prompts
- **Returning users**: Will see streamlined authentication
- **Privacy**: Users can choose to hide their email (Apple provides relay email)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Sign in Failed" or No Response

**Solution:**
- Verify Sign in with Apple capability is enabled in Xcode
- Check that entitlements file is linked in Build Settings
- Ensure App ID has Sign in with Apple enabled in Developer Portal
- Clean build folder: `Product > Clean Build Folder` in Xcode

### Issue 2: "Invalid Client" Error

**Solution:**
- Your Bundle ID in Xcode must match the App ID in Developer Portal
- Current Bundle ID: `com.isaac.MyMeds-UKultra`
- Regenerate provisioning profiles after enabling capability

### Issue 3: Simulator Shows "Apple ID Not Available"

**Solution:**
- Sign in to Apple ID in Simulator Settings
- Use iOS Simulator 13.0 or later
- Try different simulator devices

### Issue 4: "Credential Not Found" on App Launch

**Solution:**
- This is normal behavior - it means the user hasn't signed in yet
- The app will prompt for sign in when needed
- Not an error - this is expected flow

### Issue 5: Email Always Shows "Private Relay"

**Solution:**
- This is by design - users can choose to hide their real email
- Store the user ID (not email) as the primary identifier
- Email may be "privaterelay.appleid.com" address
- Our implementation handles this correctly

## 📱 How It Works in Your App

### Authentication Flow:

1. **User taps "Sign In" button** → Opens LoginView
2. **User taps "Sign in with Apple"** → Triggers auth flow
3. **Apple prompts for Face ID/Touch ID** → User authenticates
4. **App receives credentials** → Saved securely to Keychain
5. **User is signed in** → HasAccess status updated
6. **View automatically dismisses** → Returns to main app

### Session Management:

- **Persistent Login**: User stays signed in across app launches
- **Credential Checking**: App verifies credentials on launch
- **Revocation Detection**: App signs out if user revokes access from Settings
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Sign out removes all stored data

---

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

1. **Keychain Storage** - Credentials never stored in UserDefaults
2. **Nonce Verification** - Prevents replay attacks
3. **Credential State Checking** - Detects revoked access
4. **Secure Token Handling** - Proper verification flow
5. **Privacy Compliant** - Minimal data collection

---

## 📝 Code Structure

### Key Files:

- `AuthenticationService.swift` - Main authentication logic
- `LoginView.swift` - Sign in UI
- `KeychainHelper.swift` - Secure storage
- `MyMeds_UKultra.entitlements` - Capabilities configuration

### Authentication Properties:

```swift
authService.isAuthenticated  // Bool - Is user signed in?
authService.user             // AppleUser? - User data
authService.userDisplayName  // String - Display name
authService.hasAccess        // Bool - Has premium access
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Development:

1. Enable Sign in with Apple capability in Xcode (if not auto-detected)
2. Test on Simulator with Apple ID signed in
3. Test on physical device for full experience

### For Production:

1. Ensure App ID has Sign in with Apple enabled
2. Create production provisioning profiles
3. Test with TestFlight before release
4. Add Terms of Service and Privacy Policy URLs

## 💡 Tips

1. **Don't remove Apple's button styling** - Follow HIG guidelines
2. **Handle privacy relay emails** - Don't assume real email is provided
3. **Test revocation** - Go to Settings > Apple ID > Password & Security > Apps Using Apple ID
4. **Store user ID, not email** - Email can change or be hidden
5. **Provide clear error messages** - Help users understand what went wrong
